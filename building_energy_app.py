st.title("SmartEnergy: Predicting Building Energy Consumption")

# Summary of application
st.write("""**Welcome to our Energy Consumption Prediction Platform**

In an era where sustainability is key, optimizing energy use in buildings is more important than ever. 
Our platform uses advanced data analytics and machine learning to predict energy consumption in real-time. 
By considering factors such as building type, size, occupancy patterns, and environmental conditions like temperature, 
we provide building owners and managers with actionable insights to reduce energy waste.

Our mission is to help create smarter, more sustainable buildings. 
By utilizing cutting-edge technology, we enable better decision-making that leads to cost savings, environmental benefits, and efficient energy use. 
Whether you're managing a single building or an entire portfolio, our solution is designed to promote energy conservation and optimize your building's performance.""")
